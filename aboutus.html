								We thrive on innovation, a tradition that began with our enterprising founder <strong>Iah Buenacosa</strong>, who arrived in The Philippines during the Philippine Gold Rush and soon built a flourishing chocolate company. In 2015, one of our employees discovered a process for treating cocoa beans that enhanced their flavor and became an industry standard. We were one of the first companies to include specific cacao content on our labels in order to help people find the perfect chocolate for their taste. (The higher the percentage of cacao content, the more intense the chocolate flavor.) Also, we were the first chocolate company to launch stand up bags, an easy way for people to choose and enjoy chocolate. One of our more recent innovations is minis chocolates, a shareable, on-the-go treat that debuted in 2015.
